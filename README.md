# shared-wallet
A wallet that allows owner to deposit/withdraw funds and other whitelisted addresses to withdraw based on a restriction.

# Real-World Use-Case for this Project
-	Allowance for Children per day/week/month to be able to spend a certain amount of funds.
-	 Employers give employees an allowance for their travel expenses.
-	Businesses give contractors an allowance to spend a certain budget.

# Development-Goal
-	Have an on-chain wallet smart contract.
-	This wallet contract can store funds and let users withdraw again.
-	You can also give "allowance" to other, specific user-addresses. 
-	Restrict the functions to specific user-roles (owner, user)
-	Re-Use existing smart contracts which are already audited to the greatest extent. 
-	Apply restrictions by time based on timestamp.
-	Access by whitelist.
-	Update internal balance in a secure manner with audited libraries.
